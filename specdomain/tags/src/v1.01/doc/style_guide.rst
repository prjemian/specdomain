SPEC Documentation Style Guide
===============================================================================

Some interesting and applicable words from the `Google Style Guide 
<http://google-styleguide.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/pyguide.html?showone=Comments>`_:

	BE CONSISTENT.
	
	If you're editing code, take a few minutes to look at the code around you 
	and determine its style. If they use spaces around all their arithmetic 
	operators, you should too. If their comments have little boxes of hash 
	marks around them, make your comments have little boxes of hash marks 
	around them too.
	
	The point of having style guidelines is to have a common vocabulary of 
	coding so people can concentrate on what you're saying rather than on 
	how you're saying it. We present global style rules here so people know 
	the vocabulary, but local style is also important. If code you add to a 
	file looks drastically different from the existing code around it, it 
	throws readers out of their rhythm when they go to read it. Avoid this. 

With these words in mind, these are the style guides to use for SPEC macros at the APS ...
